# OSLearn

This is a hobby OS project. The evolution is likely to be roughly as follows:

1. Single process, command line interface
2. Multi-process
3. Graphical interface
4. Whatever I feel like

The above list is subject to change. This OS will not be compatible with existing software and will not be developed with security in mind, at least at first. This project will never be suitable as a daily driver.
